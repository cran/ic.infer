Change Log for R-package ic.infer


Version 1.1-1 (18 December 2009)
- removed LICENSE file that erroneously claimed a geographical restriction to non-US
  since version 0.8. ic.infer is not and has never been geographically restricted,
  but is subject to GPL >=2.

Version 1.1 (20 November 2009)
- added contrast function contr.diff for increment coding of factors with 
  ordered levels 
- added function make.mon.ui for easier creation of matrix ui in monotonicity situations
- corrected orlm.Rd (quotes in code blocks)
- added two data examples (bodyfat and grades)

Version 1.0-6 (19 September 2008)
Bug fixes:
- orlm and or.relimp did not work properly for linear models on data
  frames without column names.
- bootstrapping did not work on models with factors because of an
  undocumented and unnecessary stopping condition in internal function
  boot.orlm.

Version 1.0-5 (16 August 2008)
- improved error message when using orlm or or.relimp with non-quadratic matrix
- added tests directory for standard automated code testing
- added examples for summary.orest to documentation
- Bug fixes:
  - Fixed typo that made ic.test use asymptotic instead of finite df test, when
    applied to linear model object
  - or.relimp did not work for covariance matrices without column names

Version 1.0-4 (14 August 2008)
- Namespace now exports summary function for class orest (erroneously yielded
  default summary before, although a special method had been added with version
  0.8-2)
- Added helpful error message for plot.orlm, when applied to object that was
  generated based on covariance matrix and therefore without residuals

Version 1.0-1 to 1.0-3 (13 August 2008)
- Prohibit simultaneous occurrence of restriction on intercept and bootstrap
  (consequence of switching to covariance-matrix based calculation in bootstrap)
- Bug fix for internal function orlm.forboot (index – 1 replaced by index in
  call)
- Bug fixes for ic.weights (even and odd sums were wrongly implemented and only
  worked for some numbers of restrictions)

Version 1.0 (12 August 2008)
- ic.weights saves additional time on weight calculation by exploiting that odd and
  even weights each sum to 0.5.
- orlm and or.relimp can now operate based on a covariance matrix only and do
  not necessarily require a linear model for input.
- all.R2 now requests a covariance matrix instead of a linear model for input (it
  should not be necessary for users to directly call all.R2).
- Bootstrapping in orlm is now based on the covariance-matrix-based calculation for
  option fixed=FALSE. Thus, issues are avoided in making bootstrapping work with
  functions that indirectly call lm.
• The documentation has been updated and improved in some respects.
Version 0.8-3 (01 August 2008)
•
