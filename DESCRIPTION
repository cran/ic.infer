Description: Implements inequality constrained inference. This includes parameter estimation in normal (linear) models under linear equality and inequality constraints, as well as normal likelihood ratio tests involving inequality-constrained hypotheses. For inequality-constrained linear models, averaging over R-squared for different orderings of regressors is also included.
